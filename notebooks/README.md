## 💡 Current Focus

The current version of this project emphasizes **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
- Cleaned the dataset and handled missing values using median imputation  
- Analyzed feature distributions and correlations  
- Visualized major cardiovascular risk factors  
- Summarized findings to guide modeling decisions

## 🔮 Upcoming Notebooks

Future notebooks will extend this work to:
- Engineer meaningful features  
- Build and tune machine learning models  
- Evaluate results using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC
